**A squad of eleven Claude Code agents, and a watcher that keeps them honest, built on [AgenFK](https://github.com/cglab-public/agenfk).**

AgenFK gives an AI coding session a board, a flow and gates: no card, no edit; no
evidence, no next step. The squad adds what a single gated session still lacks
once you run several of them at the same time:

- **Roles with hard limits.** One agent per job, each with a fixed set of tools.
  The one that reviews cannot edit. The one that writes infrastructure stops at `plan`.
- **A watcher that measures instead of asking.** A hook reads every session's
  transcript once a minute and acts on the numbers: it orders a handoff before
  the context window fills, cuts a sub-session that loops, refuses a new
  dispatch when the orchestrator is already too heavy, and makes merges to the
  main branch take turns.
- **A way out of every refusal.** The watcher never just says no. Each denial
  tells the session where the work continues: here, in a fresh session, or with
  the owner.

It is a small thing: Markdown prompts, four Python hooks with no dependencies
beyond the standard library, and one test suite. It is also an open question.
The rules here came from watching real sessions fail, and there are many
failures we have not seen yet. If you run AI agents in parallel, we want your
evidence and your rules. See [Contributing](#contributing).

## The problem

Give a capable model a large task and permission to spawn sub-agents, and four
things go wrong, in this order.

1. **Context becomes the largest cost, and nobody is watching it.** A session
   at 600k tokens of context pays for those 600k again on every turn. It also
   reasons worse. The session itself is a poor judge of when to stop: it either
   stops far too early ("my context is getting high") or never.
2. **Orchestrators fan out without limit.** Sub-agents feel free to the session
   that spawns them. They are not.
3. **The author approves its own work.** A session that wrote the code, asked to
   review it, finds it correct. Asked again, it finds it correct again.
4. **Parallel sessions collide at the merge.** Each merge moves the main branch
   under the others. Every session then resolves the same conflict, and the
   resolution is stale by the time it is pushed.

The limits in this repository were set after one week in October 2026, on one
machine, running five projects:

| What was measured | Value |
|---|---|
| Context of the orchestrating sessions | 420k to 966k tokens |
| Sub-agents spawned | 249 |
| Share of all token consumption that went to sub-agents | 64% |
| Projects orchestrating at the same time, overnight | 5 |
| Times a single card was sent to review | 5 |

None of those sessions was misbehaving by its own lights. Each step was
reasonable. The squad exists because reasonable steps add up to that table.

## How it fits together

Three layers, each doing one job:

| Layer | What it owns | What it refuses |
|---|---|---|
| **AgenFK** | The card, the flow, the evidence for each step | Editing without a card; advancing without evidence |
| **Squad agents** | One role each, with a fixed tool list | Approving your own code; merging, applying, deploying, publishing |
| **Watcher hooks** | The context budget, the dispatch limits, the merge queue | A dispatch from a session that is too heavy; a merge out of turn; a looping sub-session |

The flow that ties the layers together ships in
[`flows/squad-delivery.json`](flows/squad-delivery.json): each step names the
agent that owns it and the evidence `agenfk verify` has to carry.
[docs/agenfk-integration.md](docs/agenfk-integration.md) has the full table.

## The agents

| Agent | Role | Writes? | Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| `product` | Says where the project really is, cuts the goal to the smallest usable increment, breaks it into cards | No (creates cards in TODO) | inherit |
| `github` | Maps who is in which worktree and branch, plans parallel fronts over disjoint files, proposes the merge train | Worktree claims only | inherit |
| `developer` | Turns exactly one card into code, on its own branch and worktree | Yes | inherit |
| `frontend` | Interface, components, design systems, motion, visual pieces, with a measured quality floor | Yes | inherit |
| `tester` | Writes the card's tests and proves by mutation that each one can fail | Test files only | Sonnet |
| `verifier` | Independent review in a clean context: REVIEW, ADVERSARIAL, MUTATE, VERIFY. Returns `SHIP`, `FIX_FIRST` or `REJECT` | No | Sonnet |
| `infra` | Terraform, CI/CD, Dockerfiles. Stops at `plan` | Yes, never `apply` | inherit |
| `finops` | Prices a cloud design line by line; measures token spend per card and model | No | inherit |
| `finance` | Unit economics, pricing, margin, break-even | No | inherit |
| `gtm` | Positioning, competitors, landing copy, outreach scripts | No (drafts only) | inherit |
| `context` | Measures context, burn and rereading per session; decides continue, compact, hand off or cut | Handoffs and card comments only | Sonnet |

Full catalogue with limits: [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md).

## The watcher in one screen

`hooks/squad-watch.py` runs on six Claude Code hook events and speaks to the
session in messages that start with `[squad-watch]`.

| It sees | It does |
|---|---|
| Main session at 80% of its window, or rereading itself for 60% of its spend above a floor that weighs how much it has already burned | `PROACTIVE HANDOFF`: the session writes a handoff and stops; the watcher clears the pane and a fresh session picks the work up |
| A sub-session repeating the same call, or past 180k of context | Denies the call; the sub-session returns a short handoff to its parent |
| An orchestrator at 600k of context, or with 40 sub-sessions, or a fourth session orchestrating at once, or a seventh reviewer on one card | `DISPATCH DENIED`, with the way forward spelled out |
| A merge to main while another session holds the turn | Denies it, queues the session, and wakes it with `MERGE TURN` |

Every threshold is an environment variable. The arithmetic, with worked
examples, is in [docs/watcher.md](docs/watcher.md).

## Quickstart

You need Claude Code, Python 3.10 or newer, `git`, and AgenFK.

```bash
# 1. AgenFK first: the squad assumes its CLI is on your PATH
#    https://github.com/cglab-public/agenfk#installation--setup

# 2. The squad
git clone https://github.com/eduardopin/agenfk-squad.git
cd agenfk-squad
./install.sh          # symlinks into ~/.claude; never overwrites a real file

# 3. Register the hooks in ~/.claude/settings.json
#    (snippet in docs/installation.md)

# 4. See what your sessions are costing right now
python3 skills/session-context/scripts/session_context.py --detail
```

`install.sh` links `CLAUDE.md` as your **global** Claude Code instructions. If
you already have a `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, the installer skips it and tells you;
merge the two by hand. Read [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md) before
running it on a machine you care about.

Then open a project that has an AgenFK board and ask for something:

```
> start the export-to-CSV feature
[squad route] product -> `product` agent (real state of the repo, smallest increment, cards in AgenFK).
```

## Specialising for one project

A file in `<project>/.claude/agents/` with the **same name** replaces the squad
agent in that project. Most of the time you do not need one: write the rules in
the project's `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`. Every squad agent reads those before
it acts, and they take precedence over this repository, as does the project's
AgenFK flow. A `DESIGN.md` at the root guides `frontend`.

## Status

This is the working setup of one person, published as it is. It runs daily on
Linux with Claude Code. The automatic session switch depends on the
[herdr](docs/installation.md#optional-dependencies) pane manager; without it the watcher still
orders the handoff and you type `/clear` and `/clear-pickup pickup` yourself.
The session report reads Codex and pi transcripts too, but the hooks only
drive Claude Code. [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) lists what that leaves open.

## Contributing

**Using Claude Code or another coding agent from outside this organization?**
Use the [external contributor agent protocol](docs/external-contributor-agent.md)
as a copy-paste onboarding guide. It covers safe isolation, GitHub fork/PR setup,
validation, and approval before publishing company material.

**Community contributions are welcome.** You do not need write access or an
invitation to contribute: fork this public repository, make changes on your own
branch, and open a pull request (PR). Maintainers review and merge changes into
`main`.

We value evidence over speculative rules. Especially useful contributions are:

- A watcher failure you observed, with context metrics and the
  `[squad-watch]` output (remove sensitive data before posting).
- Measured improvements to thresholds, handoffs, parallel work or merge safety.
- Support for other agent harnesses (Codex, pi, Gemini CLI, OpenCode).
- Reproducible tests, fixes, documentation and examples.

See [the roadmap](ROADMAP.md) or [open issues](https://github.com/eduardopin/agenfk-squad/issues)
to find work. For non-trivial changes, open a
[proposal](https://github.com/eduardopin/agenfk-squad/issues/new/choose) first
so the approach can be discussed before implementation.

### Contribute in six steps

1. **Fork** this repository using GitHub's **Fork** button.
2. **Clone your fork**, add this repository as `upstream`, and create a
   descriptive branch:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agenfk-squad.git
   cd agenfk-squad
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/eduardopin/agenfk-squad.git
   git switch -c fix/describe-the-change
   ```

3. **Make one focused change**, following
   [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). A hook change must include a regression
   test that fails without the fix. Do not include private transcripts, session
   IDs, customer names, credentials or machine-specific paths.
4. **Run the checks** before submitting:

   ```bash
   python3 tests/test_watch.py
   python3 -m py_compile hooks/*.py skills/session-context/scripts/session_context.py
   bash -n install.sh
   ```

   You do **not** need to run `install.sh` to develop or test this repository.
   It changes your local Claude Code setup; use the isolated test procedure
   in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to test installation.

5. **Push your branch** to your fork and open a PR against
   `eduardopin/agenfk-squad:main`:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: describe the behavior corrected"
   git push -u origin fix/describe-the-change
   ```

   Use the [Pull Requests page](https://github.com/eduardopin/agenfk-squad/compare)
   or the link GitHub shows after pushing. Complete the
   [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md), explaining the failure,
   the change and the test evidence.

6. **Respond to review and CI results.** GitHub Actions checks incoming PRs
   on Python 3.10, 3.12 and 3.14. Maintainers review the change; an approved,
   passing contribution can be merged by a maintainer. You never need direct
   write access to `main`.

**Project standards:** keep PRs small; provide evidence for behavioral changes;
prefer Python's standard library for hooks and scripts; document changes to
watcher messages, thresholds and environment variables. New agent roles need
evidence from two projects. The full requirements are in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Safety and community:** follow the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Report vulnerabilities privately using
[GitHub's vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/eduardopin/agenfk-squad/security/advisories/new),
not public issues. By contributing, you agree to license your contribution
