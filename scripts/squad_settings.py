"""Registers and removes the squad's hooks in Claude Code's settings.json.

The hooks and their events come from hooks/manifest.json; nothing here lists
them. Standard library only. Used by get.sh, and safe to run by hand:

    python3 scripts/squad_settings.py check     [--config DIR]
    python3 scripts/squad_settings.py install   [--config DIR] [--manifest FILE]
    python3 scripts/squad_settings.py uninstall [--config DIR] [--manifest FILE]

--config defaults to ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}; the file is
<config>/settings.json, and each hook command runs <config>/hooks/<script>,
the link that install.sh creates.

Guarantees:
  - every other key, and every hook that is not the squad's, stays as it was;
  - running install twice changes nothing the second time (no write at all);
  - before any write, the current file is copied to settings.json.bak-<timestamp>;
  - a settings.json that is not valid JSON, or not shaped like Claude Code's
    settings, is never written: the command stops with exit code 2;
  - a settings.json that is a symlink stays a symlink: its target is updated.

A hook entry is the squad's only when its command is an interpreter and a
path, nothing more: `python3 <path>` or `python <path>`, and on Windows also
`py -3 <path>` or a quoted absolute interpreter (`"C:/.../python.exe" "<path>"`).
<path>, after ~ and $VARS are expanded,
is <config>/hooks/<script> for one of the manifest's scripts, or resolves to
one of them inside the clone this script belongs to. So the entries from
docs/installation.md (`python3 ~/.claude/hooks/squad-watch.py`) are
recognised, kept on install and removed on uninstall, while a hook of the
user's that merely shares a file name (`python3 /opt/mine/squad-watch.py`,
`grep squad-router.py log`) is never touched.

The manifest decides each squad hook's matcher: a hook's own "matchers"
({event: matcher}, where null means no matcher) wins over the top-level one.
A squad entry found under any other matcher on that event (moved by hand, or
left by an older manifest) is moved to the manifest's, so a narrow hook never
stays registered on every tool call. A moved entry keeps the timeout it had;
one with a null or 0 timeout gets the manifest's.
No matcher, "" and "*" all match every tool in Claude Code, so they count as
one matcher here: an entry under any of them is where a "*" (or no matcher)
in the manifest wants it, and stays put. A manifest that lists one script
twice on the same event is refused (install would move it back and forth on
every run); uninstall reads only the script names and events, so a manifest
that install refuses does not stop it. Copies of one squad hook under matchers
Claude Code reads alike collapse to the first one, which takes the timeout the
user gave any of them (one that differs from the manifest's).
