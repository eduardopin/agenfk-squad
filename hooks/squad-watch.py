"""Squad sentinel: watches every Claude Code session and sub-session from the inside.

Registered on PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SubagentStop, Stop, UserPromptSubmit and
PreCompact (PostToolUseFailure, where the harness has it, only gives a merge turn
back).

  PostToolUse       records the call; warns about loops; every CHECK_EVERY seconds
                    reads what was appended to the transcript and redoes the math
                    (session_context.handoff_math): context, burn, reread versus
                    new work, payback. A sub-session at the threshold is ordered
                    to send back the return handoff; a main session is ordered to
                    write the handoff (clear-pickup mode A) on its own, before it
                    overflows.
  PreToolUse        sub-sessions only: denies the identical repeated call (loop)
                    and, above the context ceiling, denies everything except
                    git/agenfk, so the sub-session has to send back the return
                    handoff.
  SubagentStop      writes the sub-session's metrics to ~/.claude/squad/metrics.jsonl
                    and leaves a note for the parent session when it ended badly.
  UserPromptSubmit  delivers the pending notes to the main session.
  Stop              main session at handoff level: if it stopped without writing
                    the handoff, the order is sent back; if it stops again
                    without it, the watcher writes the handoff itself (git, the
                    owner's last request, denied dispatches). With a handoff and
                    nothing running in the background, it launches
                    squad-switch.py, which clears the herdr pane and calls the
                    pickup, so the session switch happens without the owner.
                    SQUAD_SWITCH=0 turns the switch off.
  PreCompact        main session only, manual or auto: before the conversation is
                    summarized, writes the same minimal handoff to
                    ~/.claude/squad/handoffs/<session>-compact.md. Prints
                    nothing, so it never blocks the compaction, and never
                    switches the session.

The stop is always soft: the watcher warns first (DISPATCH NOTICE), only the new
dispatch is denied, the task in progress finishes, and it is the watcher that
drives the handoff and the restart of the work in the new session. The brief of
every denied dispatch is kept in full in
~/.claude/squad/handoffs/<session>-dispatches.md.

It never brings a session down: any error ends silently with exit code 0. What
it prints is data measured here; tool and agent names go through clean() before
they leave.

Thresholds, by environment variable:
  SQUAD_SUB_CTX_WARN (120000)  SQUAD_SUB_CTX_CUT (180000)  context tokens
  SQUAD_SUB_BURN      (2000000) weighted burn of one sub-session
  SQUAD_WINDOW                  window of the main session (default: 1000000)
  SQUAD_CTX_BASE      (40000)   context of a fresh session, for the payback
  The main session's handoff (level 2) is arithmetic, with no judgement by the agent:
      context >= SQUAD_CTX_PCT (80)% of the window, OR
      reread >= SQUAD_REREAD (60)% AND context >= floor
      (reread = 0.1*cache-read / weighted burn, the cockpit's REREAD %; minimum floor 2*CTX_BASE)
  The floor weighs the burn: SQUAD_REREAD_FLOOR (50)% of the window once the burn
  has reached SQUAD_BURN_FULL (50)% of the session budget (CLAUDE_SESSION_BUDGET,
  20M, the cockpit's BURN %), rising in a straight line to 80% with zero burn.
  Context at 50% with burn at 10% is NOT handoff time: the floor there is 74%. A
  session that has just built its context and barely used it is not cut.
  In other words: the cut falls between 50% and 80% of the window. Above 50%
  without the math closing, only an informational notice goes out (level 1),
  with no order to stop.
  SQUAD_CTX_WARN (0) SQUAD_CTX_HANDOFF (0)  absolute thresholds in tokens, off by default
  SQUAD_CTX_CEILING (600000)    above this, dispatch denied and handoff ordered
  SQUAD_MAX_SUBS      (40)      sub-sessions per main session
  SQUAD_MAX_ORCH      (3)       sessions orchestrating sub-agents at the same time
  SQUAD_ORCH_HERE     (120000)  no orchestrator slot: below this the card is done
                                in the session itself; from here up, handoff with
                                the plan and a new session
  SQUAD_MAX_REVIEWS   (6)       reviewer dispatches for the same card
  SQUAD_WATCH=0                 turns it off

A denied dispatch is never just a "no": the message says where the work continues.
  context ceiling / sub-session ceiling  handoff with the plan of the denied dispatch;
                                     the session switch is armed and the pickup continues
  no orchestrator slot, implementation
      context <  SQUAD_ORCH_HERE     implement right here, with no agent
      context >= SQUAD_ORCH_HERE     handoff with the implementation plan; the new
                                     session (clean context) implements directly
  no orchestrator slot, reviewer     carry on with whatever does not depend on the
                                     verdict; the watcher announces SLOT FREE when
                                     there is a slot
  7th reviewer on the same card      the owner's decision, with what keeps failing

Merge turn (one per repository, ~/.claude/squad/turn/): the turn covers only the
merge call itself (`gh pr merge`, direct push to the trunk, merge_pull_request), not
the sync, the suite or CI. Holding it through all of that left sessions waiting
for hours.
  merge call
      turn free or yours     the PreToolUse takes it; the PostToolUse of the same
                             call gives it back, success or failure (also on
                             PostToolUseFailure); a turn held longer than
                             SQUAD_TURN_HOLD (120 s) expired
      another session's      denied for those seconds: repeat the merge shortly
  before a PR merge, with the turn held: `git fetch` of the base and
      `git merge-tree --write-tree origin/<base> <PR head>`. A conflict is
      denied (MERGE CONFLICT) with the files and where the work continues; a
      clean merge passes, with no new suite asked for.
  seal (opt-in: `git config squad.seal true`, or SQUAD_SEAL=1; SQUAD_SEAL=0 turns
      it off): a PR merge passes only if the PR head SHA has a SHIP seal, a push
      to the trunk only if the pushed SHA has one (MERGE SEAL). Seals are written
      by `squad-seal record` in ~/.claude/squad/seals/<repo hash>/<sha>.json.
  trunk: main, master, the remote's default branch (origin/HEAD, or `gh repo
      view` when that ref is missing) and `git config squad.trunk` (a
      comma-separated list); a push whose destination, or whose push target with
      no refspec, is one of them is a push to the trunk; so is `push origin HEAD`
      with the trunk checked out.
  where: a merge or push is checked in the directory it runs in, the cwd moved
      by each literal `cd` before it and by `git -C`. When that cannot be told
      (a variable or quotes in the path, `cd -`, a subshell, a cd that may not
      run, as in `a && cd x;` or `cd x || y`, pushd, GIT_DIR, env -C, a missing
      directory) and the seal is on or unknown, it is denied. A push counts then
      only if it may send the current branch or names a trunk of the session's
      repository; outside any repository, every push counts.
  sync with main is never denied.
  `squad-turn request [PR] | release | status`   record an intent (it blocks
      nobody), drop it, see who is merging and the intents
SQUAD_TURN=0 turns all of it off: the turn, the conflict check and the seal.
With the seal on, a check that cannot run (git or gh failing or timing out, an
unreadable seal, an unknown PR head, an exception) denies the merge. Merge
commands are recognised in any position (bash -c, ssh, eval, xargs, watch...);
text counts as data only as the value of -m/-d/--body/--title/--description/
--evidence or an echo/printf argument on a line of inert commands. This guards
against an agent's mistake, not against someone set on getting around it: the
guarantee comes from the squad/seal commit status required by the branch
protection on the trunk.

The dispatch ceilings exist because of one week of October 2026: orchestrators
with 420-966k of context, 249 sub-agents (64% of the consumption), five projects
orchestrating overnight and one card judged five times.

## Ground truth (commands run by the watcher)

Branch: {git_out(cwd, 'branch', '--show-current')}

`git status --short`:
{git_out(cwd, 'status', '--short') or '(clean)'}

`git log --oneline -5`:
{git_out(cwd, 'log', '--oneline', '-5')}

## Owner's last request

{st.get('last_prompt') or 'UNKNOWN'}

## Denied dispatches

{('Briefs in full, in the order in which they were denied: ' + briefs) if os.path.exists(briefs) else 'None kept.'}

## Next step

1. Check git against what is above and read the card in progress and its comments.
2. If there are denied briefs, they are the plan: execute them in order. Try the dispatch; if the watcher
   denies it, do what the denial says (with a light session, implement right here).
3. With no briefs: continue the owner's last request from what git and the card show as done.
4. If it is not possible to tell what remains, ask the owner before editing.
