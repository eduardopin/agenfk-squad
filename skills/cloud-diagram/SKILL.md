name: cloud-diagram
description: The squad's standard for cloud architecture diagrams (AWS, OCI, GCP, Azure, Alibaba, Cloudflare): a technical sheet in hand-drawn inline SVG, with groups nested in the provider's convention (cloud → region → VPC → zone → subnet), service icons in the category colours, a service spanning zones drawn as a dashed band, orthogonal arrows that never cross, numbered steps tied to the list, a stamp and a legend, the drawing's status in the stamp (CURRENT as of a date, or PROPOSED), an inventory with a source per node before the geometry, the page chrome dressed in the project's design system (the design-reference sweep), tokens in both themes, a probe that measures overlap, sideways scrolling and the status before delivery, and a .drawio deliverable with a gate (diagram_check.py) when asked for. Use it whenever you draw, redo or review an architecture, infrastructure, network or service-flow diagram for the cloud (in an Artifact, HTML page, doc, ADR, README or proposal), including when it goes with a cost quote (finops) or a design review (infra). It replaces mermaid, exported draw.io or generic boxes.

# cloud-diagram: the squad's architecture sheet

The standard grew out of an architecture drawing the owner approved, and it is
the reference for any cloud diagram. Before drawing, open the two files:

- `references/template.html`: the kit to copy. Light and dark tokens, the
  "diagram sheet" CSS block, the `<defs>` library (groups, services, items
  outside the cloud), a sample drawing and the steps script.
- `references/example.html`: a worked example on a fictional product (photo
  uploads, serverless, no VPC). It is an example, not a rule: it shows the
  floor of quality for the whole page (diagram, stamp, legend, linked steps,
  an inventory with a source per node).

Copy the kit and swap the drawing. Do not redesign the grammar on every request.

## 0. The project decides

A diagram skill of the project's own (`.claude/skills/`) wins over this one.
The **page chrome** (background, surface, text, accent, title and body font)
wears the design system of the project at hand:

```bash
python3 -I ~/.claude/skills/design-reference/scripts/sweep.py <root> --css
```

Paste the output in place of the `--ds-*` block in `template.html`; the rest
of the page reads only from it. With no design system in the project, the
built-in default stays (the neutral sheet). The provider's category colours do
not change with the project and live only inside the diagram. The condensed
face on the labels (`--label`) still holds; if the project has a condensed
face, it goes there. Say in one line which system the page wears.

## 1. Content comes from whoever knows

The diagram shows the architecture that was decided, not an invented one. Cost
comes from `finops`, with source and date. Never add a service to "complete"
the drawing. Detail and examples in `references/inventory-and-drawio.md`.

- **Inventory before geometry.** List the nodes and arrows (type and label of
  each arrow) with the **source of each node**: IaC, state, a read-only read
  of the account (a `-ro` profile), ADR, card or request. What you assumed
  goes in a list and in the answer. Data missing: ask, or draw only what is
  certain.
- **Status stated.** The stamp says CURRENT as of YYYY-MM-DD (with the source)
  or PROPOSED. Before and after are two sheets, each with its own.
- **Audience.** Technical readers get service, protocol, port, CIDR, counts;
  executives get action labels and numbered steps, no implementation. Ask once
  if it is not obvious.
- **Two tests before drawing.** Isomorphism: every box is a real resource and
  every arrow a real flow, and the shape alone already says something.
  Education: the reader learns something a list would not give; if not, write
  the list.
- **Boundaries follow the real hierarchy.** Nest only what exists; a boundary
  drawn for tidiness looks like a security boundary.

## 2. The grammar (not negotiable)

**Sheet.** A `.sheet` with a 1.5 px border in the ink colour and its own
surface. Under the drawing, a **stamp** (`dl.stamp`, five cells: Status,
Region, Zones, Network, State; Status is CURRENT as of a date or PROPOSED,
State is about the application's state) and the **legend** (category colours,
"outside the cloud", solid call, dashed background). Below the sheet, the
`ol.steps` list "The path of …".

**Nested groups, outside in**, each level 16 px inside the previous one, with
a 20–22 px group icon at the top-left corner and the label beside it (`.gl`,
13 px, 500). A zone carries its label centred at the top.

| Level (AWS) | Stroke | Class |
|---|---|---|
| AWS Cloud | solid, squid ink | `g-cloud` + `c-cloud` |
| Region | round dotted `2 4`, teal | `g-region` + `c-region` |
| VPC | solid, purple | `g-vpc` + `c-vpc` |
| Availability Zone | dashed `8 5`, blue, no icon | `g-az` |
| Public subnet | filled light green, green outline | `g-sub` + `c-sub` |
| Private subnet | filled light teal, teal outline | `g-priv` + `c-priv` |

Global services (CloudFront, Route 53, IAM) sit inside the cloud and outside
the region. Regional services with no VPC (S3, SQS, DynamoDB, Lambda outside
a VPC, Secrets Manager) sit inside the region and outside the VPC, in a column
or band of their own.

**Service.** A square in the category colour with a white glyph of stroke 2
(`.gy`): 48 px for a managed service, 44 px for a task or instance, 36 px
inside a support group. A two-layer label: name in `.t` (14.5 px, 600, ink)
and up to three lines of detail (13 px, secondary ink), below and centred when
the icon sits in a row, to the right when it sits in a stack. The detail says
the role in the drawing ("job queue", "1 writer instance"), not the service's
definition.

**Service spanning zones** (ECS service, Auto Scaling group, cluster): an
orange dashed band `g-svc` across both zones, with one instance drawn in each
zone and the name in the middle. It shows multi-AZ without repeating the
service. Support tools that run together go in a `g-aux` group (dashed
`3 3`, neutral) with a title and "1 task each".

**Outside the cloud** (client, app, browser, third-party SaaS, Cloudflare,
push service, messaging app): a neutral outlined square (`k-ext`) with a glyph
in ink (`.gx`). Never use a third party's logo or brand colour. Clients on the
left, third parties the API calls above, outputs (push, email) on the right.

**Arrows.** Horizontal and vertical only, 1.5 px, a single marker (`#ah`).
They never cross; a fork gets a junction dot (`.jn`, r 3.5). A call is solid;
whatever runs in the background (queue, push, replica) is dashed `6 5`, and
only that dash moves, turned off under `prefers-reduced-motion`. An arrow never
runs over a label nor through an icon; it goes around the group.

**Numbered steps.** A balloon of r 11 (`g.st`, `data-s="n"`) on the step's
arrow; the `ol.steps` list has the same numbers, and the script lights both
together on pointer hover. Six steps is the right size; past eight, split into
two drawings.

**Colour.** The provider's category colours live only inside the diagram. The
page has a single accent (the lit balloon, the main series of a chart). Every
SVG text uses a text token, never the category colour.

## 3. Category colours

AWS (Architecture Icons; group values were darkened where contrast asked for
it, and dark mode lightens the strokes, not the squares):

| Token | Light | Dark | Category |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--aws-compute` | `#ed7100` | `#ed7100` | Compute (EC2, ECS, Fargate, Lambda) |
| `--aws-db` | `#c925d1` | `#c925d1` | Database (RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB) |
| `--aws-int` | `#e7157b` | `#e7157b` | Application Integration (SQS, SNS, EventBridge) |
| `--aws-storage` | `#7aa116` | `#7aa116` | Storage (S3, EFS) |
| `--aws-net` | `#8c4fff` | `#8c4fff` | Networking (CloudFront, ALB, Route 53, API Gateway) |
| `--aws-sec` | `#dd344c` | `#dd344c` | Security, Identity (Secrets Manager, Cognito, WAF) |
| `--aws-cloud` | `#232f3e` | `#c9d2da` | AWS Cloud group |
| `--aws-region` | `#00868a` | `#2fc4c6` | Region group |
| `--aws-vpc` | `#8c4fff` | `#a98bff` | VPC group |
| `--aws-az` | `#147eba` | `#55aee6` | Zone group |
| `--aws-subnet` / `-fill` | `#7aa116` / `#f0f5e2` | `#93c01f` / `#17231a` | public subnet |
| `--aws-private` / `-fill` | `#00868a` / `#e3f2f2` | `#2fc4c6` / `#122226` | private subnet |

## 4. Other providers

The grammar is the same; the levels and the palette change.

| Provider | Levels, outside in |
|---|---|
| OCI | Tenancy → Region → Compartment → VCN → Availability Domain (→ Fault Domain) → Subnet |
| GCP | Organization/Project → Region → VPC (global) → Zone → Subnet (regional) |
| Azure | Subscription → Resource group → Region → VNet → Zone → Subnet |
| Alibaba | Account → Region → VPC → Zone → vSwitch |
| Cloudflare | edge outside the project's cloud; Workers, R2, D1 in a "Cloudflare" group of their own |

Another provider's category colours come only from its official icon kit, with
the URL and date in a CSS comment. Without the kit checked, use the AWS palette
by category and say so in the legend; do not invent a brand's palette.

## 5. Layout before coordinates

1. List the nodes and the arrows with each one's step.
2. Lay out a grid of columns: clients | edge | cloud (zones side by side) |
   regional | outputs. Third parties in a row above. Main flow left to right,
   asynchronous going down.
3. Trace the arrows on paper (ASCII) before writing the SVG; if two cross,
   move a node, do not draw over it.
4. A `viewBox` about 1200 wide, integer coordinates, labels at least 12 px
   clear of the arrows and of the group borders.
5. The SVG sits in `.scroll > .dia` with `min-width:1040px`; under 1120 px the
   "swipe sideways" hint appears. The page body never scrolls sideways.

## 6. Page contract

- SVG with `role="img"` and an `aria-label` that narrates the whole flow in
  prose; the scroll container with `tabindex="0"`, `role="region"` and a label.
- Chrome read from the `--ds-*` block (section 0); the sheet maps `--page`,
  `--surface`, `--ink`, `--accent` and the fonts from it.
- Tokens in `:root`, redefined in `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` under
  `:root:not([data-theme="light"])` and in `:root[data-theme="dark"]`. No
  literal colour in the SVG outside the tokens (the white glyph is a token too).
- No external image, icon or fetch: everything inline. Fonts only from Google
  Fonts, with a condensed fallback stack.
- Sheet typography: the project's title and body (`--ds-font-*`), condensed on
  the diagram labels (Barlow Semi Condensed in the template).
- In an Artifact, load the Artifact page contract skill too; with a cost chart
  alongside, a data-visualisation skill. For `frontend`, this skill is the "one
  design skill" next to `design-reference`.

## 7. Verification (before delivering)

```bash
~/.claude/skills/cloud-diagram/scripts/render.sh <page.html> <folder> "1100 400"
```

It writes `shot-<theme>-<width>.png` in both themes and runs the probe: label
over label, label over icon, balloon over label, arrow cutting a label, arrow
through an icon, arrow crossing an arrow away from a junction, body scrolling
sideways, fonts loaded, and the stamp's **Status** cell (CURRENT with a date or
PROPOSED; without it, or "current" with no date, it fails). Chrome comes from
`$CHROME` or from `google-chrome`/`chromium` on the PATH. Under 500 px the page
runs in an iframe of the exact width, because headless Chrome opens no smaller
window. Exit 1 = it found a problem; exit 2 = no Chrome to render with.

The probe measures geometry; the eye measures reading. Open the 1100 px shots
in both themes and check: group hierarchy readable, nothing cut off, contrast.
Fix everything in one batch, run once more, stop.

## 8. When asked for .drawio

The HTML page with the inline SVG is the default editable source. If the owner
asks for draw.io: official `mxgraph.aws4` shapes with a checked stencil name,
the file saved uncompressed, the preview exported with the XML embedded, every
edge attached at both ends, and the gate:

```bash
python3 -I ~/.claude/skills/cloud-diagram/scripts/diagram_check.py name.drawio
```

It fails bad XML, a compressed page, a duplicate id, a floating edge, a label
that reads as AI-written (the `writing` skill's lexicon, or a small built-in
one when that skill is not installed) and a drawing with no CURRENT-with-a-date
or PROPOSED. Then render it and look. Rules and the full table in
`references/inventory-and-drawio.md`; a clean fixture in `fixtures/clean.drawio`.

## 9. Delivery

```
Status       [CURRENT as of YYYY-MM-DD (source) | PROPOSED]
Diagram      [provider · levels drawn · no. of services · no. of steps]
Source       [inventory: where each node and number came from]
System       [design system the page wears, or "neutral sheet"]
Probe        [render.sh output, the 4 lines]
Shots        [paths light/dark, desktop/phone]
My labels    [what you named with no source, for the owner to check]
```

## Origin

The squad's visual grammar, born in a drawing the owner approved. Inventory
before geometry, current/proposed status, audience, the two tests, the real
hierarchy, the draw.io deliverable and `diagram_check.py` come from six
cloud-diagram skills (MIT and Apache-2.0), rewritten; attribution in
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
