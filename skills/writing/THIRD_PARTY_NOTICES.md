## humanizer

MIT License. Copyright (c) the humanizer authors. Distributed at

The pattern catalogue in `references/patterns.md`, the false-positive
discipline in `references/false-positives.md` and part of the English lexicon
in `scripts/slop_lint.py` derive from it.

## Wikipedia: Signs of AI writing

The humanizer patterns are themselves based on
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing>, maintained by
WikiProject AI Cleanup. Wikipedia text is available under CC BY-SA 4.0. The
patterns here are restated and re-exemplified rather than copied; the
attribution is kept because the analysis is theirs.

## no-ai-slop

By petergyang, distributed at `petergyang/no-ai-slop`. No licence file ships
with the upstream skill. Voice preservation, the minimum-effective-edit
principle, the portability test, the Detect job and part of the lexicon in
`scripts/slop_lint.py` derive from it; the rules are restated in this skill's
own words, not copied.

## claudekit `brand`

MIT License, per the upstream repository. The brand-voice axes in
`references/voice-profile.md` are restated from it. The MIT permission notice
above applies to that material as well.

## caveman

Apache License, Version 2.0 (<https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>).
Copyright 2026 Julius Brussee. Distributed at `JuliusBrussee/caveman`.

The lean mode, the commit message rules and the Compress job in
`references/lean.md`, and the evidence discipline of the Detect job in
`SKILL.md`, restate rules from its `caveman`, `caveman-commit`,
`caveman-compress` and `caveman-evidence-review` skills. Changes: the
compressor that sends the file to a model provider is replaced by a local
rewrite gated by `scripts/fidelity_check.py`; the hosted-service specifics of
the evidence review are dropped and only its reporting rules are kept.

## The original authors' writing skills

The sentence test, the measure table, the document shapes, the pt-BR lexicon,
`slop_lint.py` and `fidelity_check.py` come from two internal writing skills
(`plain-technical-writing` and `human-friendly-docs`) contributed by this
repository's author; they are not third-party material and are listed here for
provenance.

## Cloud diagram rules

The diagram rules that derived from cloud diagram skills live in the
`cloud-diagram` skill, together with their attribution.
