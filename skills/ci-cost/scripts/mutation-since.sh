# Diff-scoped mutation testing for a pull request: mutate only the LINES the branch changed.
#
# StrykerJS 10 has no `--since`; its `--incremental` depends on a stored result file surviving in a
# CI cache, and a cache miss silently turns a short job into a full run. So the diff is computed
# here, explicitly, and handed to Stryker as an exact `--mutate` list of line ranges (see
# changed-ranges.mjs). No cache, no hidden state, and the same command reproduces locally what CI did.
#
# Usage:  mutation-since.sh [base-ref]                         (default: origin/main)
#   TARGETS="name:config.mjs:path/prefix/ other:other.mjs:pkg/src/"   one Stryker config per prefix
#   STRYKER_BREAK=60                                            the PR run's floor (see below)
#
# Needs real history: `actions/checkout` with `fetch-depth: 0`, or the merge-base has nothing to
# resolve against. Run it AFTER the cheap gates (`needs:` + `if: needs.<job>.result == 'success'`),
# so a red or superseded commit burns no mutation minutes.
