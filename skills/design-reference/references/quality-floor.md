# Quality floor and anti-patterns

Load this after the direction has been decided and immediately before editing
UI. A fixed brief or the project's already committed visual world beats any
item in here; your habit does not.

## A. Verify in the built result (Impeccable, craft floor)

- **Contrast:** body and placeholder ≥ 4.5:1, large text ≥ 3:1 (large means
  24 px and up, or 18.7 px and up in bold). Measure the pair as composited
  (transparency, image, state, both themes) and never round 4.49 up to 4.5.
  Use 3:1 for control borders, action icons and focus indicators. Colour may
  carry an error or a selection, but not as the only signal: pair it with
  text, an icon or a shape. Secondary text on a coloured surface tinted from the hue
  or from the foreground; never grey.
- **Depth:** a shadow has an offset and a soft blur. A coloured halo with no
  offset is decoration.
- **Space:** tight groups, generous separation, more space above a heading
  than below it. Read the computed values.
- **Type:** body measure 65–75ch; display ≤ 6rem; minimum tracking -0.04em;
  balanced headings (`text-wrap: balance`); obvious steps of scale and weight.
  Run the real copy at every breakpoint and fix whatever overflows.
- **Motion:** one authored moment, not scattered effects nor the same entrance
  on every section. Exponential ease-out from an already visible state. Blur,
  `backdrop-filter`, `clip-path`, mask and shadow join the palette when they
  stay smooth.
- **States:** hover, disabled, loading, error, empty. Plus real content,
  working controls, responsive composition, keyboard focus.
- **Browser surfaces:** selection, caret, scrollbar, focus ring,
  `text-underline-offset`, tabular numerals — theme them from the palette.
- **Copy:** the product's language. A control names the action; an error names
  the problem and the way out.
- **Coverage:** every requirement in the brief present and findable in seconds.

### Refuse by default (the brief can win any of them back — except the one marked)

Page skeletons:
- Cards of the same size (icon + title + text) as the structure of the page.
  The card is the lazy container; a card inside a card is always wrong.
- The "hero metric" template: big number, small label, supporting stats,
  accent.
- **Kicker/eyebrow above the heading — banned, no brief wins it back.**
  The heading carries its own weight.
- Section numbering (01 / 02 / 03) unless the sequence carries information the
  reader needs.
- A modal for a task that needs neither interruption nor protected focus.

Surface habits:
- Gradient text. Emphasis comes from weight or size.
- Glass and blur as decoration, rather than as a specific effect.
- Coloured `border-left`/`border-right` above 1px on a card, item, callout,
  alert.
- Hard offset shadow (`box-shadow: 4px 4px 0`) outside a genuinely
  neobrutalist world.
- Sparkline, progress ring and rounded rectangle with a soft shadow in place
  of content.
- Monospace as a "technical" costume instead of for code, data, measurement.
- A system display font (Impact, Arial Black, the platform's sans) as the
  voice of a page with a world of its own. Download and self-host the right one.
- A Unicode glyph or emoji in place of an icon system.
- A geometric mask (circle, polygon, radial gradient) pretending to be the
  organic outline of a photo. Derive an alpha matte from the image or produce
  the cutout.
- Light or dark chosen by category. Choose by the scene of use: who, where,
  under what light.

## B. Web checklist (Web Interface Guidelines, Vercel) — output as `file:line`

**Accessibility.** An icon-only button has an accessible name; every form
control has a label; everything interactive works by keyboard; a native
element (`button`, `a`, `label`, `table`) before ARIA; `alt` on a meaningful
image, a decorative one hidden; an asynchronous update announced
(`aria-live="polite"`); headings in order without skipping a level; skip link;
media with captions/alternative and keyboard control.

**Focus.** Visible indicator; never `outline: none` without a replacement;
prefer `:focus-visible`; grouped focus in a composite control; fixed UI does
not cover the focused element.

**Forms.** `autocomplete`, a meaningful `name`, correct `type` and
`inputmode`; pasting allowed; clickable label; `spellcheck=false` on e-mail,
code, username; submit enabled until the request starts, spinner during it,
inline error with focus on the first one; a placeholder is an example ending
in an ellipsis; a warning before losing an unsaved change.

**Animation.** Reduced motion respected; only `transform` and `opacity`;
transitioned properties listed explicitly (never `all`); correct
`transform-origin`; interruptible; long autoplay has a pause.

**Typography.** Ellipsis character (…), curly quotes, non-breaking space where
it fits; a loading label ends in …; tabular numerals in a numeric column;
`text-wrap: balance`/`pretty` on a heading.

**Content.** Long text truncates or wraps; a flex child can shrink
(`min-width: 0`); empty state handled; test short, medium and very long.

**Image.** Explicit dimensions (CLS); lazy below the fold, priority above it.

**Performance.** Long list virtualised; no layout read during render; DOM
reads and writes batched; cheap controlled input; `preconnect` to the asset
domain; critical font preloaded; muted looping video instead of a GIF.

**Navigation and state.** UI state reflected in the URL; a real link
(modifier-click works); a destructive action confirms or offers undo.

**Touch.** `touch-action: manipulation`; intentional tap highlight;
`overscroll-behavior: contain` on a modal; no text selection and an inert
element during drag; a touch and keyboard alternative for a gesture;
`autofocus` rare.

**Safe areas and layout.** `env(safe-area-inset-*)` in full-bleed; no
horizontal scroll; layout by CSS, not JS measurement.

**Dark mode.** `color-scheme` on the root; `theme-color` meta equal to the
background; native `select` styled explicitly.

**i18n.** `Intl` for dates and numbers; language from the browser preference,
not the IP; brand and code tokens marked as non-translatable.

**Hydration.** Controlled input with a handler; a rendered date guarded
against server/client mismatch.

**Hover.** Button and link with feedback; hover, active and focus stronger
than the resting state.

**Copy.** Active voice; a numeral for a count; a specific label; an error with
what to do next; second person.

**Anti-patterns to flag:** a viewport that disables zoom; paste blocking;
`transition: all`; outline removed; a click handler on a non-semantic element;
inline navigation without a link; an image with no size; a large list without
virtualisation; an input or icon button with no label; hardcoded date/number
format; unjustified `autofocus`; a GIF where a video would do; a
gesture-only action.

## C. Motion — review table (Emil Kowalski)

| Before | After | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `transition: all 300ms` | `transition: transform 200ms var(--ease-out)` | explicit property; `all` animates what it should not |
| `transform: scale(0)` | `scale(0.95); opacity: 0` | nothing in the real world appears out of nowhere |
| `ease-in` on a dropdown | custom `ease-out` | ease-in delays the start, exactly where the user is looking |
| no `:active` on the button | `:active { transform: scale(0.97) }` | the button has to respond to the touch |
| `transform-origin: center` on a popover | `transform-origin` at the trigger | a popover is born from where it was called; a modal stays centred |
| animation on a keyboard shortcut | none | an action repeated 100+ times/day never animates |
| slow spinner | faster spinner | perceived speed goes up with the identical load |

Curves: `--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)`;
`--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1)`;
`--ease-drawer: cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)`. Do not invent a curve:
easing.dev or easings.co.

## D. Mobile and native (UI/UX Pro Max)

Target ≥ 44×44pt (Apple) / 48×48dp (Material), 8px between targets. The
WCAG 2.2 AA floor is lower and has its own exceptions: 2.5.8 asks 24×24 CSS px
on the web, and a smaller target still passes when its spacing leaves a 24px
circle around it clear of every other target. Under 24×24 with no exception is
a fail; between 24 and the platform policy is a warn to look at, not a WCAG
failure. The full rule and the component measurements are in
`references/mobile-patterns.md`; account, permission, billing and store flows
are in `references/product-flows-and-store.md`.

No reliance on hover; press feedback (ripple / highlight); the platform's
standard gesture never redefined; a system gesture never blocked; the primary
target away from the notch, the Dynamic Island and the gesture bar; swipe with
a visible affordance; a movement threshold before starting a drag; Dynamic
Type/system text scale without truncation; `accessibilityLabel`/`Hint` with a
logical reading order; an escape route (cancel/back) in every modal and
multi-step flow.
